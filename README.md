git init REPO_NAME
cd REPO_NAME

git commit --amend
--> 체berarbeitet letzten commit

git reset --hard
--> macht alle 채nderungen seit letztem commit r체ckg채ngig

**Note** Directories are not tracked, just add a '.keep' file

to ignore files add them to '.gitignore':
...
log/*.log
...

To just add parts to the index we can user 'git add -p' ('-p' as in "patch").

## Disaster Recovery

In case of deleted commits use 'git reflog' and 'git cherry-pick' to recover those commits:
...
git cherry-pick LOST_COMMIT_SHA1
...

**Note** Will be cleaned up once 'git gc' ran.

## Getting information out of history

Use 'git log --oneline --graph' to get condensed log view.

Use 'git blame' to see **last** change for each line.

Use 'git show COMMIT_SHA1' to get detailed information about commit (including diff).

Use 'git log -S' to search in contents of commits

## Branches

Branches are essential for any gift workflow. To create a new branch run

...
git cheackout -b BRANCH_NAME
...

To list all your branches you can run (the active branch will be marked with a '*')

...
git branch
...

Possible workflow options:

1. Add commits as usual in your branch. When ready 'git rebase --interactive master' to cleanup your commits
2. To merge branch back into 'master' use 'git merge --ff BRANCH_NAME' ('--ff' means fast-forward / rebase)
3. you can even squash the branch 'git merge --squash'
4. Use 'git reset --soft' if you accidently added commits to 'master'
5. Make sure to merge/rebase 'master' **before** merging your branch into 'master'
